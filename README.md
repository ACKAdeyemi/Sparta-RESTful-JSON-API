<hr>

#### Task:

This is a homework task to be completed with a main purpose of providing context towards API and Integration testing in Rails. This task will be completed by following this [RESTful JSON API tutorial](https://scotch.io/@austin) by Austin Kabiru

This task makes use of:

* **Rails 5** (to build API)
* **RSpec** (testing framework)
* **Factory Bot** (fixtures replacement with a more straightforward syntax)
* **Shoulda Matchers** (provides RSpec with additional matchers)
* **Database Cleaner** (cleans test database to ensure a clean state in each test suite)
* **Faker gem** (library that generates random fake data)
